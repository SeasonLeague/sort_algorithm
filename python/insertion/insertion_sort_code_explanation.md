1. `def selection_sort(arr)`: - This line defines a function named selection_sort that takes a single argument arr, which should be a list of numbers.

2. `n = len(arr)` - This line calculates the length of the input list arr and assigns it to the variable n. 

* The code uses two nested for loops to perform the sorting:
   * The outer loop: `for i in range(n)` - This loop runs from `0` to `n-1` and represents the index of the current element that will be considered as the minimum element in the unsorted portion.

   * Inside the outer loop, there is an inner loop: `for j in range(i + 1, n)` - This loop iterates through the unsorted part of the list, starting from the next element after the current `i`. It's used to find the minimum element in the unsorted part.

3. Inside the inner loop, there's an if statement: `if arr[j] < arr[min_index]:` - This condition checks if the element at index j is smaller than the element at the current min_index.

4. If the condition is True, it updates min_index to the index j, which means that `arr[min_index]` now holds the index of the smallest element in the unsorted part of the list.

5. After the inner loop completes, the code swaps the element at `i` with the element at min_index to place the smallest element at the beginning of the unsorted part. This is done using the line: `arr[i], arr[min_index] = arr[min_index], arr[i]`.

6. The outer loop continues to increment `i`, and with each iteration, the smallest unsorted element is moved to its correct position in the sorted part of the list.

7. After all iterations, the entire list is sorted in ascending order.

Finally, the sorted list is printed using `print("Sorted list:", my_list)`.
