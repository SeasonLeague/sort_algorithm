Selection Sort works by dividing the list into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. The sorted part starts as an empty list, and the algorithm repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted part and moves it to the sorted part. Here's how it works step by step:

Find the minimum (or maximum) element in the unsorted part of the list.
Swap it with the leftmost element of the unsorted part, which becomes the last element in the sorted part.
Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted parts one element to the right.
Repeat these steps until the entire list is sorted.
