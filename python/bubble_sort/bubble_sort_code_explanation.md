* `def bubble_sort(arr)`: - This line defines a function named bubble_sort that takes a single argument arr, which should be a list of numbers.

* `n = len(arr)` - This line calculates the length of the input list arr and assigns it to the variable n.

* The next part of the code consists of two nested for loops. These loops are used to iterate over the elements in the list and perform the sorting.

* The outer loop: `for i in range(n)` - This loop runs n times, where n is the length of the list. It represents the number of passes needed to sort the list.

* The inner loop: `for j in range(0, n - i - 1)` - This loop iterates through the elements in the list. n - i - 1 is used to avoid unnecessary comparisons, as the largest element in the unsorted portion of the list has already "bubbled up" to its correct position.

* Inside the inner loop, we have an if statement: `if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:` - This checks if the element at the current position (arr[j]) is greater than the element next to it `(arr[j + 1])`.

* If the condition in the if statement is True, it means the elements are out of order, so they are swapped using this line: `arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]`.

* The loop continues to compare and swap adjacent elements until the largest element "bubbles up" to the end of the list. This process repeats for each pass of the outer loop.

After all the passes are completed, the list is sorted in ascending order.

Finally, the sorted list is printed using `print("Sorted list:", my_list)`.
